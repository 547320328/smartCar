# smartCar
The smart car is a highly computerized automobile featuring ubiquitous computing, intuitive human-computer interaction and an open application platform. Here, we propose an advanced Smart Car demonstration platform with a transparent windshield display and various motion sensors where drivers can manipulate a variety of car-appropriate applications in augmented reality. Similar to smartphones, drivers can customize their Smart Car through free downloads of car-appropriate applications according to their wants and needs. 
智慧汽車是一種高度電腦化的汽車，它有直觀的人機交互和開放的應用平臺。在此，我們提出了一種先進的智慧汽車演示平臺，該平臺具有透明擋風玻璃顯示幕和各種運動感測器，駕駛員可以在增強現實中操縱各種適合汽車的應用。與智慧手機類似，駕駛員可以根據自己的需要和需求，通過免費下載適合自己的汽車應用程式來定制自己的智慧汽車。
